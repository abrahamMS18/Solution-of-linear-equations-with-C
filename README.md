# Solution-of-linear-equations-with-C

Hi everyone!, in this repo you can find the solution of linear equations with systems 2x2(Gauss-Jordan), 3x3(Gauss-Seidel) and nxn(Gauss-Jordan).
I'm trying very hard to solve, be pacient. I made this, because in some parts of internet the code you will see is so hard to read and maybe, 
my code is similar, but it has much more explanation and maybe you can understand what I coding. 

You are free to change it.

The only thing I ask you is, If you do a change in the code, write, what change you do. 

Hope this code is usefull for you. 

If you have any questions, send me an email: abraham_1097@hotmail.com

Enjoy!
