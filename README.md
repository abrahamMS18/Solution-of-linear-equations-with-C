# Solution-of-linear-equations-with-C

Hi everyone!, in this repo you can find the solution of linear equations with systems 2x2(Gauss-Jordan), 3x3(Gauss-Seidel) and nxn(Gauss-Jordan).
I'm trying very hard to solve, be pacient. I made this, because in some parts of internet the code you will see is so hard to read and maybe, 
my code is similar, but had a lot of explanation and maybe you can understand what I coding. 

You are free to change it.

The only thing that I can ask you if, If you realize a change in the code, notice, what change you do. 

Hope this code is usefull for you. 

If you have any questions, send me an email: abraham_1097@hotmail.com

Enjoy!
